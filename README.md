# NewHome
## New friend, new home

### Description
I created this project because it was a tech assessment part of Fetch Rewards' hiring process for the Frontend Engineer Apprenticeship. It is a web application that allows users to search for different dogs that are in shelters to help the user find a new pet and find the pet a new home. I learned more about using TypeScript in React and Redux Toolkit. I also used TailwindCSS to style the page with a mobile first approach. Some challenges I faced were figuring out how to manipulate the URL string for adding more query parameters like multiple breeds, using an object oriented programming approach, and frontend testing.

### Usage
The project has a live site for you to view and use here: 
To use locally, you can download the ZIP files and once you unzip it and are in the root directory, use the following commands:
cd dogfinder
npm i
npm start

You can then view it at [http://localhost:3000].
